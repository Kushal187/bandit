using ls we can find a file called sshkey.private
we have to log into bandit14 user
for this we have to use ssh -i command at localhost
i is for identity file
command : ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost
once in bandit14 we have to go to the directory /etc/bandit_pass using cd
use ls
we find bandit14
cat bandit14 and obtain password

copy the key 
create tmp directory
go to tmp directory and create file called sshkey.pvt using touch sshkey.pvt

paste the rsa key and save and exit
now change permissions of sshkey.pvt using:
chmod 700 sshkey.pvt
